# Redmine Default Subtask Tracker plugin #

This is a plugin for Redmine 2 to set a default tracker for subtasks. Each tracker can have one default tracker as a subtask. It is still possible to change the tracker.

This plugin was hacked together based on the Redmine [Issue Inherit Fields plugin](https://github.com/edosoft/redmine-inherit-fields-plugin) by Edosoft.
